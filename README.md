# Unveiling-Gender-Bias-in-GloVe-word-embeddings
"Unveiling Gender Bias in GloVe Word Embeddings" is a groundbreaking research endeavor that delves into the intricate layers of gender bias present in GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) word embeddings. This study aims to expose and analyze the subtle yet impactful biases embedded within the linguistic representations generated by GloVe, a popular word embedding technique.

The research involves a meticulous examination of the learned vector representations for words related to gender and explores how these embeddings may inadvertently perpetuate or reflect societal gender biases. By employing advanced analytical techniques and methodologies, the study systematically unveils the nuances of gender bias, shedding light on the specific terms and contexts where biases are most pronounced.

The implications of such gender bias in word embeddings are thoroughly discussed, emphasizing the potential consequences in natural language processing applications, including machine learning models, sentiment analysis, and language generation. The research not only contributes to the understanding of bias in word embeddings but also proposes strategies and techniques to mitigate and address these biases, fostering more equitable and unbiased language representations.

In essence, "Unveiling Gender Bias in GloVe Word Embeddings" serves as a pivotal contribution to the field, raising awareness about the challenges associated with gender bias in natural language processing and providing valuable insights for developing more fair and inclusive language models
